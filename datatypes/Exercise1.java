/*
	Java Data Type: Exercise-1 with Solution
Write a Java program to convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius degree.

The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. 
It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: Â°F) as the unit.

The Celsius scale, previously known as the centigrade scale, is a temperature scale used by the 
International System of Units (SI). As an SI derived unit, it is used by all countries in the world, except the U.S.

Test Data
Input a degree in Fahrenheit: 212
